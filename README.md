# Project template for rp2040-hal

This template is intended as a starting point for developing your own firmware based on the rp2040-hal.

It includes all of the `knurling-rs` tooling as showcased in https://github.com/knurling-rs/app-template (`defmt`, `defmt-rtt`, `panic-probe`, `flip-link`) to make development as easy as possible.

`probe-run` is configured as the default runner, so you can start your program as easy as
```
DEFMT_LOG=trace cargo run --release
```

## Requirements
- The standard Rust tooling (cargo, rustup) which you can install from https://rustup.rs/

- Toolchain support for the cortex-m0+ processors in the rp2040 (thumbv6m-none-eabi)

- flip-link - this allows you to detect stack-overflows on the first core, which is the only supported target for now.

- probe-run. Upstream support for RP2040 was added with version 0.3.1.

- A CMSIS-DAP probe. (JLink probes sort of work but are very unstable. Other probes won't work at all)

  You can use a second Pico as a CMSIS-DAP debug probe by installing the following firmware on it:
  https://github.com/majbthrd/DapperMime/releases/download/20210225/raspberry_pi_pico-DapperMime.uf2

  More details on supported debug probes can be found in [debug_probes.md](debug_probes.md)

## Installation of development dependencies
```
rustup target install thumbv6m-none-eabi
cargo install flip-link
# This is our suggested default 'runner'
cargo install probe-run
# If you want to use elf2uf2-rs instead of probe-run, instead do...
cargo install elf2uf2-rs
```

## Running

For a debug build
```
DEFMT_LOG=trace cargo run
```
For a release build
```
DEFMT_LOG=trace cargo run --release
```

To load firmware directly into RP2040, for example you don't have a probe, comment and uncomment following lines in `.cargo/config.toml`:

```
[target.'cfg(all(target_arch = "arm", target_os = "none"))']
# runner = "probe-run --chip RP2040"
runner = "elf2uf2-rs -d"
```

<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Roadmap

NOTE These packages are under active development. As such, it is likely to
remain volatile until a 1.0.0 release.

See the [open issues](https://github.com/rp-rs/rp-hal/issues) for a list of
proposed features (and known issues).

## Contributing

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to be learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

The steps are:

1. Fork the Project by clicking the 'Fork' button at the top of the page.
2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Make some changes to the code or documentation.
4. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
5. Push to the Feature Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
6. Create a [New Pull Request](https://github.com/rp-rs/rp-hal/pulls)
7. An admin will review the Pull Request and discuss any changes that may be required.
8. Once everyone is happy, the Pull Request can be merged by an admin, and your work is part of our project!
